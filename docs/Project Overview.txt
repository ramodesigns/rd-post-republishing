Project Overview
The WordPress Post Republishing Plugin is a content recycling system designed to automatically republish existing posts to make them appear as fresh, new content. The plugin simulates deleting the original post and creating it anew, updating all timestamps and triggering WordPress's natural post publication workflow.

Core Functionality
Republishing Process
Definition: Complete timestamp refresh that makes posts appear as newly published content
Updates: Both post_date and post_modified fields are updated to current timestamp with randomized time
WordPress Integration: Triggers all standard WordPress post publication hooks and actions
Cache Management: Automatically clears relevant caches to ensure immediate visibility
Post Selection Algorithm
Strategy: Oldest-first selection ensuring systematic content recycling
Minimum Age: Configurable threshold (7-180 days, default: 30 days) before posts become eligible
Cycling Logic: Previously republished posts re-enter the pool when they become the oldest eligible content
Cross-Type Priority: When multiple post types are enabled, absolute oldest across all types gets priority
Technical Requirements
Environment Specifications
PHP Version: 8.2+ compatibility (2025 standard)
WordPress Version: 6.6 minimum
Architecture: Single-site only (multisite support deferred to future phases)
Caching Compatibility: Full compatibility with popular caching plugins
Daily Republishing Logic
Quota System: Explicit number (1-50 posts) OR percentage-based (max 50 posts regardless of percentage)
Time Randomization: Posts receive random timestamps between configured hours (default: 9 AM - 5 PM, 24-hour format)
Order Preservation: Optional feature to maintain chronological order of selected posts within the day
Safety Limits: Hard maximum of 50 posts per day to prevent timeouts
Database Schema Requirements

API Endpoint Specifications
Endpoint Design
URL: /wp-json/republish/v1/trigger
Method: POST
Authentication: WordPress Application Password required
Rate Limiting: Configurable (default: 1 call per day)
Response Formats
Debug Mode ON: Detailed JSON with post array, IDs, timestamps, success/failure status
Debug Mode OFF: Simple success/failure boolean
Empty Response: Success=true with empty post array if daily quota already completed
Security Features
WordPress nonce validation
User capability verification
Request throttling with configurable limits
Comprehensive logging of API access attempts
Scheduling System
Dual-Mode Operation
WP Cron Mode (Default): Utilizes WordPress's built-in scheduling system
External API Mode: Webhook endpoint for external schedulers with built-in safety checks
Error Handling & Retry Logic
Failure Detection: Individual post republishing failure tracking
Retry Mechanism: Single retry attempt 30 minutes after initial failure
Selective Retry: Only failed posts are reattempted, not the entire batch
Comprehensive Logging: All failures and retries recorded in history
